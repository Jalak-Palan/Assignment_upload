 <h3><mark>Future goal</mark></h3>
<p>My goal is to become a versatile front-end developer and UI designer who bridges the gap between clean code and compelling design. Iâ€™m building a strong foundation in semantic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git workflows, while exploring visual design principles through tools like Figma. I aim to create accessible, responsive, and visually consistent web experiences that not only function well but also feel intuitive to users.</p>
