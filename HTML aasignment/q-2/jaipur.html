<h1>jaipur</h1>
<p>- Founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, Jaipur was one of the first planned cities in India, designed using principles of Vastu Shastra.
- The city was built to replace Amber (Amer) as the capital due to population growth and water scarcity.
- Its nickname comes from the pink hue of its buildings, painted in 1876 to welcome the Prince of Walesâ€”a symbol of hospitality.
