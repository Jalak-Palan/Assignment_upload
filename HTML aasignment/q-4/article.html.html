    <h1><u>History of Computers and the Internet</u></h1>
    <p>
      The story of computing is a journey from <strong>simple calculation</strong> to
      <em>planet-scale communication</em>. Early ideas about machinery and logic gradually formed the
      <b>foundations</b> of devices that could follow instructions, remember results, and repeat operations.
      As engineers iterated, they replaced fragile mechanisms with <i>reliable electronics</i> and refined
      how people talk to machines using <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and graphical
      interfaces. Across this narrative, what counts as a “computer” has expanded from room-sized equipment
      to <mark>pocket devices</mark> that exceed the power of old mainframes. The Internet linked these machines,
      creating an <em>information fabric</em> that carries news, code, and culture. Today, we edit, learn, and
      collaborate online in ways that earlier pioneers only <q>dreamed</q> about, yet those dreams set the stage
      for the <ins>modern</ins> world after many ideas were <del>dismissed</del> and later revived.

    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>
      In the early era, devices such as the abacus and mechanical calculators provided <em>basic</em> assistance,
      but they lacked programmability and <strong>memory</strong>. Visionaries proposed engines that could follow
      <b>symbolic instructions</b>, and these proposals foreshadowed the use of variables like
      <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> to represent changing values. Mathematics guided design, from
      series expansions to formulas like E = mc<sup>2</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O, which inspired a habit of expressing
      ideas as <i>precise notation</i>. The first electronic machines used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark> and
      performed operations with limited reliability, yet they proved the <em>concept</em> of general computation.
      Interfaces were awkward, often relying on switches, patch panels, and paper tapes where a single
      <strong>bit</strong> error could halt a run. Meanwhile, acronyms began to appear—such as
      <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> for the processor and <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr>
      for memory—signaling a growing technical language that users had to learn. Even then, people quoted designers
      who said, <q cite="#">we must teach the machine our logic</q>, a line that still resonates.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
      Historians often describe “generations” that mark big shifts: tubes to transistors, transistors to integrated
      circuits, and then to microprocessors that fit a <b>whole CPU</b> on a single chip. Each jump brought smaller size,
      lower power, and <strong>higher speed</strong>, which you can feel in simple relationships like
      a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> for geometry or a<sub>i</sub> terms inside algorithms for sums and loops.
      With time, <em>operating systems</em> matured and introduced <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> concepts
      that reduced the need to memorize every command. As reliability increased, companies standardized buses, storage,
      and I/O, replacing fragile ideas that were <del>hard-wired forever</del> with designs that could be
      <ins>updated and modular</ins>. Programming languages evolved, letting developers write clearer logic and use
      <code>functions()</code> to organize work. The outcome was not just faster machines, but a <mark>friendlier</mark>
      way for humans to engage with computation and data. Even educational texts began to include
      <small>gentle introductions</small> and inline notes to help new learners pace themselves.

    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>
      Networking emerged when researchers connected distant computers to share time and knowledge across
      <abbr title="Wide Area Network">WAN</abbr> links and local <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr> segments.
      Protocols like <abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol">TCP/IP</abbr> helped different
      systems speak a common language with <em>packets</em>, addresses, and routes. The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>
      layered documents on top, using <b>hyperlinks</b> and <i>uniform resource locators</i> to stitch pages into a
      global library. While early pages were plain, the Web adopted markup such as <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> for meaning and structure. Email, forums, and chat created
      a culture of <strong>participation</strong>, where users not only read but also contributed, debated, and remixed.
      Soon, search engines and caching reshaped how information was discovered and delivered. Even the etiquette of typing
      changed; for instance, pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> became a quick escape, while <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>
      reminded everyone to save their work at <mark>regular</mark> intervals.

    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>
      Today’s landscape blends powerful hardware with cloud services, turning a phone into a doorway to
      <strong>planet-scale</strong> computing. Users stream media, analyze datasets, and coordinate teams through
      <i>collaborative platforms</i> that run across browsers rendered via <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
      style rules, and scripts. Data centers exploit <b>parallelism</b>, pushing many operations at once while algorithms
      track states like N<sub>t</sub> and N<sub>t+1</sub> or compute growth as r<sup>t</sup> in compact expressions.
      Developers compare outputs—<samp>OK</samp>, <samp>ERROR</samp>, or <samp>TIMEOUT</samp>—to keep systems stable and
      responsive. Even user guides mark important notes with <mark>highlights</mark> and <em>emphasis</em> so readers
      catch key ideas quickly. Meanwhile, communities refine standards, sometimes <del>dropping</del> features and
      sometimes <ins>adding</ins> better semantics to help both people and machines. What remains consistent is the goal
      of making technology more humane, accessible, and resilient for everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider how we format knowledge for the Web: we might define a variable like <var>threshold</var> for a
      spam filter, compare it against <var>score</var>, and output a <samp>PASS</samp> only when the logic is sound.
      We still write equations such as F = ma, E = mc<sup>2</sup>, and even chemical forms like CO<sub>2</sub> to keep
      ideas <em>precise</em> and portable across disciplines. A user can navigate with keys like <kbd>Tab</kbd> and
      <kbd>Enter</kbd>, or issue a <b>keyboard shortcut</b> to accelerate workflows. When bugs appear, we contrast the
      <del>old assumption</del> with an <ins>updated fix</ins> and document the change for future readers.
      These small practices, repeated billions of times, accumulate into the <strong>reliable</strong> systems we
      depend on each day. In a sense, the Web is a living document that the world edits continuously.

    <h2>Code Demo</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a tiny snippet showing how a program might log results and handle user input. The code uses a
      <em>variable</em> named <var>n</var>, prints a message, and demonstrates sample output via <samp>lines</samp> of text.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
 Simple pseudo-code
function factorial(n) {
  if (n &lt; 0) return "invalid";
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) result *= i;  multiply
  return result;
}

 Try it
print("n = 5 → " + factorial(5));2   expected: 120
    </code></pre>
